# CV-1
My first HTML Resume, styled with CSS.

Nothing big in there just a html, css and an image used as a favicon.

Here i am **just testing** some git features.

*Here I am using git bash.* *I cloned the CV-1 repository to my mashine, made new brach using "brach", switched to new branch with "checkout" and will "stage", "commit" and "push".*
